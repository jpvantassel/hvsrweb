## For v0.3.0

### Important

- Rewrite reader to ignore endings and fail gracefully with meaningful message
to the user.
- Add another panel to control the figures appearance.
  - At least the minimum and maximum values.
- When resampling frequency is too low or too high stop calculation and inform
the user.

### Less Important

- Add SESAME clarity and reliability checking.

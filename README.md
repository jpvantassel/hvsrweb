> Dana M. Brannon and Joseph P. Vantassel, The University of Texas at Austin

## Running the Application
To run the application, you can either:
- Visit the [live website](https://hvsrpy.cb-geo.com/)
- Run locally by cloning this repository, installing the requirements, then run `python app.py` in the project directory. Your command line/terminal should show a local host url that you can copy and paste into your browser to view the app interface.

## About _Spectral_
_Spectral_ is an open-source, web-based application for performing HVSR calculations in a convenient, reliable, and statistically-consistent manner. _Spectral_ allows the user to upload three-component ambient noise records and perform the HVSR calculation in the cloud, with no installation required. The calculations in this application are performed using the Python package `hvsrpy`, which was developed by Joseph Vantassel. If you would like to know more about `hvsrpy`, please visit the [project repository](https://github.com/jpvantassel/hvsrpy).

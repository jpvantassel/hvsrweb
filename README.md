# HVSR_app

## Running the Application
To run the application, Git Bash in the same directory as calculate.py. Then, run the command `python calculate.py`\
The Bash window should show a http url that you can copy and paste into your browser. You should then see the app interface.

## Notes about this Application
* The "Calculate" and "Save Figure" buttons **do not work right now**. That has to do with "Sharing Data Between Callbacks." 
* The Settings inputs also have a parameter for min/max values, which is why some are highlighted red for certain values. I wanted to get your feedback on if we even want to use that functionality (to guide users to utilize realistic values) or not.
* I put default values for all the Settings inputs. We can change those at any time, or leave the fields entirely blank for people to fill in on their own.
* I put an "elapsed time" output right underneath the Settings panel that populates after all the graphs and tables come up. It consistently reads around 45 seconds.
